		<br><br><b>Step 1:</b><br>
			Place the swf file in the folder with the rest of the files, and run prepare_for_run.bat. When it asks for the name of swf file, enter the name of the swf file that you placed in the folder with the rest of the files and press enter. When it opens the folder at C:\tmp\Flash, do not close the folder, you will need it later.
		<br><br><b>Step 2:</b><br>
			Run "RUN" (Shortcut). It is a windows tool (C:\Windows\System32\iexpress.exe), and has existed since windows 2000, so it requires administrator privileges and the shortcut runs it with them.
		<br><br><b>Step 3:</b><br>
			Select Open existing Self Extracting Directive file. Click browse and find SED.SED (In folder with everything) or enter path to SED.SED in text box. Click next.
		<br><br><b>Step 4:</b><br>
			Leave Create Package selected and click next. Click next again. Your package is now being created!
